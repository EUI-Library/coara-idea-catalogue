We had three main activities that have contributed to the content of this platform.\n\nOpen Survey\nFrom March 2024 until January 2025, an online one-question survey was open for responses from anyone who had ideas that they wanted to contribute. Over 90 responses were submitted, with a good number of interesting and innovative ideas for potential experiments.\n\n\nWorkshops and (grey) literature review\nIn the second half of 2024, we organized two open workshops to discuss potential experiments that could be included in the idea catalogue. These workshops had participants from diverse roles and institutions, and the discussions led to both potential experiments to include as well as important themes that the Working Group could focus on in later brainstorming for potential experimental ideas..\n\n\nThe input/expertise/experience of the group + discussion\n[to be added]"

There are many potential experimental ideas that we recognize as fitting into the platform, and we welcome any constructive support in adding additional experiments.\nDue to the breadth of experimental ideas, the different experiments in the catalogue may be conflicting with one another. The goal of this platform is to value the breadth and diversity of experiments, and there is no inherent judgement of the quality of experiments, especially if they conflict with others.\nThe goal of this platform is to provide inspiration and resources for you to develop assessment experiments in your own context, but we have no guarantee on the outcomes of any experiments that you implement based on the ideas found here. We are not legally liable or responsible for your experiments, but we are happy for your feedback on your experiences."

During an application round, applicants review each other’s proposals, giving feedback and recommendations for acceptance/rejection. Quality control based on peer-review is thus restricted to those who have submitted a proposal."

    "text": "Context and considerations\n\nThis experiment can fit any target group where assessment includes several similar applications and where applicants have a minimal expertise of each other’s domains. This includes:\nFunders: looking for innovative, scalable evaluation models to reduce review fatigue and improve equity. Institutions: especially those conducting internal or competitive funding calls, or managing doctoral/postdoctoral fellowships. Thematic consortia or networks: where members share disciplinary language and goals, easing implementation.\nPotential variables that may have an influence on the distributed peer review process and may thus be valuable elements to experiment on include the identity of reviewers (e.g., anonymity vs. known identities), the size and diversity of the reviewer pool, and the language used in proposals and reviews, which may affect accessibility, clarity, and fairness across different linguistic or cultural backgrounds.\nSuggestions on how to implement\nPilot in Small-Scale Calls: Start with small funding schemes or thematic calls (e.g. internal grants, early-career researcher awards), where the administrative complexity and risks are lower. This allows for iterative refinement.\nFocus on Single-Domain or Thematic Areas: Use single-discipline or well-defined thematic areas to ensure a more homogeneous applicant pool with shared evaluation norms and language, reducing ambiguity and potential bias.\nRun Shadow Experiments: Before full implementation, run parallel (shadow) experiments alongside traditional reviews. Compare results to evaluate feasibility, reliability, and stakeholder satisfaction.\nIntegrate Peer Review Training: Provide training modules to help applicants understand the evaluation criteria and write constructive feedback. This is particularly useful for Early Career Researchers, improving both their evaluative skills and grant writing.\nImplementing distributed peer review requires careful planning and resourcing: * HR and Coordination Costs: + Project Manager: to coordinate implementation, timeline, logistics. + Administrative Support: for applicant communication, managing review assignments. * Legal and Ethical Considerations: + Legal Advisers: to ensure GDPR compliance, particularly around anonymization and data handling. + Develop terms of participation and conflict of interest policies. * Technical Infrastructure: + Platform or Tool: for proposal submission, anonymized review distribution, and scoring. + Ensure User Experience (UX) is intuitive and accessible. * Training and Support: + Develop or license training materials for applicants as reviewers. + Consider helpdesk support during the review period. * Communication and Engagement: + Clearly explain the purpose, process, and benefits to participants. + Highlight how reviews are used and how quality is monitored to foster trust."

Fostering motivation for high-quality reviews\nChallenge: Applicants may see the task as a burden or strategic opportunity, leading to superficial reviews.\nMitigation: Introduce incentives, such as recognition, certificates, or bonus points for quality reviews. Consider meta-reviews or calibration scores to assess and reward reviewer effort and reliability.\n5. Quality control of the peer review\nChallenge:Ensuring consistency and fairness across multiple reviewers.\nMitigation: Introduce a review moderation system or involve meta-reviewers who assess the quality of peer reviews.

More information can be found at: https://www.volkswagenstiftung.de/en/news/interview/volkswagen-foundation-experiments-new-peer-review-method\nThe Humboldt Foundation has been experimenting with a linked concept, namely Review Circle. In Review Circles, instead of two separate written reviews per application, a group of six to ten reviewers compare and discuss several applications on a protected digital platform. More information can be found at: https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/explore/figures-and-statistics/evaluation/evaluation-of-the-2022-peer-circle-experiment\nThe Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in Germany is currently experimenting with combined peer review formats, and has already had positive experiences. Specifically, instead of requesting peer reviews for proposals separately, the review could be done combinedly on a digital, interactive platform where researchers exchange their reviews/comments and get to discuss about the quality and innovativeness of proposals. This way, the reviewers could also directly compare the proposals with each other and rank them. https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/explore/figures-and-statistics/evaluation/evaluation-of-the-2022-peer-circle-experiment\nIterative assessments, where proposals are submitted and may be accepted, rejected or provided with feedback for the investigators to respond to, before being re-considered for funding are also being investigated with through the indigenous funding space at the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. There was a similar process formerly used in the Randomized Controlled Trials Committees of their old Open Operating Grants Program called UCR (under Continuing Review), where if the committee had simple questions that could make or break a proposal, they could rate the application provisionally based on satisfactory response to the questions. If the application then fell within the funding cut-off, the applicant would receive the question(s) and have 5 business days to respond. if the response was satisfactory they would get funded, if it wasn’t they would be deemed unfundable and would need to re-apply in a future competition.\nThe University of Antwerp is working on Comparative judgment (e.g. D-PAC), a concept that could be relevant when experimenting with distributive peer review.\nMore experiments about distributed peer review, aplicants for funding review each other’s proposals can be found from the Research on Research Institute (RoRI) at: https://researchonresearch.org/volkswagen-distributed-peer-review/"

    "text": "Context and considerations\n\nExperimenting with Narrative CVs can be relevant for a broad array of stakeholders. Documented examples and implementation of Narrative CVs have taken place in research funding organisations, research institutions, and research academies, but they Narrative CVs could realistically be implemented anywhere a traditional CV is used. Narrative CVs are most often used at an individual level, but they are also starting to be used at a team level for grant funding schemes (e.g., R4RI).\nNarrative CVs have often been implemented before experimentation, yet research funding organisations and research institutions are also experimenting on Narrative CVs to understand how they impact assessment processes, how they shape assessment decisions, and how they shape the experience of applicants and reviewers. Examples of experiments include: - Surveys with applicants to understand their perspective, use, and experience with Narrative CVs - Surveys with assessors to understand their perspective, use, and experience with Narrative CVs - Surveys with review panel members to understand their perspective, use, and experience of Narrative CVs - Interviews, focus groups, and workshops with experts to understand their perspective, worries, and hopes about Narrative CVs - Secondary data analyses of the characteristics of projects and individuals funded before and after the implementation of Narrative CVs - Content analyses of Narrative CVs to understand the type of informations included in the CV and the tone with which it is presented (e.g., sentiment analyses) - Literature review (including grey literature) to bring together evidence around Narrative CVs\nThese experiments most often aim to capture perspectives and experiences with Narrative CVs, but some also aim to capture how the implementation of Narrative CVs shapes assessment processes and decisions. These latter points of investigation are especially important for understanding the potential implications of Narrative CVs, their impact on research success, research cultures, and research practices, as well as their unintended consequences. Other elements that could be studied are the impact of training or mentoring applicants and reviewers on the Narrative CV experience, the impact of diverse templates, length, and question formulation of narrative CVs on the information included in the application, the impact of complementary material used alongside the Narrative CV, or the impact of large language models on Narrative CVs.\nMost experiments study the effects and impacts of Narrative CVs as they are implemented, rather than in a controlled trial manner. This is often a needed limitation to ensure that assessment processes remain fair and equal for all applicants. This is not a limitation per se, given that most current assessment methods were implemented without being tried-and-tested, but it opens an opportunity for metaresearch projects experimenting on Narrative CVs outside the a hiring and promotion or funding contingencies to address this gap."

    "text": "Challenges and mitigations\n\nAs mentioned above, one of the biggest challenge in experimenting with Narrative CVs is their\nSome challenges in implementing and experimenting with Narrative CVs have been documented in the literature. These include perceived challenges from (potential) users as well as reported challenges from those implementing or piloting with Narrative CVs.\nExemples of challenges include:\nChalenge - Disciplinary buy-in: While some disciplines may already be comfortable using qualitative information in an evaluative manner, other disciplines may feel more comfortable with quantitative information, and may show a resistence in prioritising qualitative elements described in the narrative CV over other forms of metrics. Mitigation: Providing a space for everyone in the community to discuss and be heard is essential to enable a shared understanding and a shared perspective among different disciplines. Creating a platform for exchange could be a way to promote such dialogues, or enabling everyone involved in the institution to be involved in discussing the implementation of narrative CVs and in shaping their implementation can play a cricial role on future buy-in. In addition, building a more thorough metrics literacy can help individuals understand the limitations and illusion of objectivity that certain metrics provide, and equip users to identify how such metrics can be used responsibly to complement qualitative information. Thorough training for assessors and reviewers may also help in this regard.\nChallenge - Perceived loss of objectivity: Narrative CVs are sometimes criticised for reducing the objectivity of applications processes, especially when compared to numerical metrics. Mitigation: Building a more thorough metrics literacy can help individuals understand the limitations and illusion of objectivity that certain metrics provide, and equip users to identify how such metrics can be used responsibly to complement qualitative information. Thorough training for assessors and reviewers may also help in this regard.\nChallenge - Labor Narrative CVs often raise a concern among applicants and reviewers because they may take more time and effort to complete and review. While the time and effort needed to complete or review narrative CVs compared to tabular CVs is debated (see FNR reports on implementation and feedback reports), introducing a new method will always take a moment of adaptation and require time and efforts by the applicants and assessors. In addition, narrative CVs are often (although not always) described as more adaptable, enabling applicants to target specific elements of the application better. Consequently, for applicants, narrative CVs may need to be taylored for each specific application, duplicating burdens and time needed for each application. Mitigation: A simple mitigation for the added labor that may be introduced by narrative CV is to reduce burden in other aspects of the process and to avoid duplication of information required - a problem that is often recurrent in any application processes. In addition, applicants may be encouraged to save and reuse their narrative CV and provided with the technical possibility of reimporting an editable version of their narrative CV in multiple applications on the same application system. Training to both assessors and applicants may also support, over time, a reduction of burdens associated with the exercise. Along the same lines, providing more time between assessments and reducing the assessment frequency (e.g., longer contracts, longer funding terms) could help secure time for better, more thorough applications.\nChallenge: Internal alignment at the organisation/change management: Ensuring that the entire organisation is aligned on the purpose for implementation can be challenging. Mitigation: Aligning the narrative CV with the objectives and purpose of the institution/hiring team/funding scheme can help support stronger alignment between the objective of narrative CV implementation and the purpose within the organisation.\nChallenge - Scalability of the process: Implementing narrative CVs may be daunting especially in small institutions or in very large programmes. Mitigation: Several organisation start implementing narrative CVs on smaller programmes (e.g., early career collaboration funds, travel funds) to pilot their implementation and all the procedures and technical and human efforts needed to embed the change. This can provide an overview of the resources needed, and enable a pave the way to larger-scale implementation."

    "section": "",
    "text": "WarningObjectives and potential outcome\n\n\n\n\nWildcards, or golden tickets, are the option given to reviewers, once per call, to unilaterally choose a proposal of their liking for direct funding. The idea is that a reviewer would spend their golden ticket on a proposal that they think is particularly promising, but that the reviewer suspects – or knows – may not be reviewed as positively by the rest of the panel, e.g., because of its risky, innovative, or niche nature. Therefore, wildcards can be considered a possible intervention to promote researchers, research topics and research ideas that are traditionally biased against by reviewers, including applicants from disadvantaged demographic groups, interdisciplinary projects, and high-risk high-reward project ideas.\nWhat happens if this is successful? What changes if this works? The adoption of a wildcard rule will be successful if it has a positive, observable impact on funding decisions. Success criteria may include: - Reviewers use their wildcards. Not meeting this goal means that no project is deemed worthy of a wildcard, and/or that reviewers do not want to take reputational risks in the review panel by unilaterally proposing a specific project. - Wildcard are spent on projects that would not be funded otherwise. Not meeting this goal means that wildcards have no impact whatsoever on funding decisions. - Proposals funded via wildcard have a distinct profile of desirable attributes – e.g., they are from traditionally disadvantaged groups of applicants, or are about traditionally disadvantaged topics. - Reviewers on the panel – both those that spent their wildcard and those who did not – see value in the wildcard option.\nWhat improvements are we aiming for? The introduction of the wildcard rule aims to mitigate the impact of negative biases by individual reviewers and by the discussion dynamics of peer review panels.\n*If there are multiple experiments fitting, put them here** There are two different flavors of wildcard rules that may have distinct advantages and disadvantages. These were never discussed in the literature – as far as I know – so I’m taking the liberty of giving them new labels: - “Postal” wildcards. This is when reviewers may use their wildcard in the postal review stage, i.e., prior to knowing what other reviewers think of the proposal. Supposed advantage: reviewers would be even less biased in their choice of project by not being exposed to the opinions of others. Disadvantage: wildcards may be more likely to be spent on projects that would be funded regardless, meaning that the wildcard would be ‘wasted’. - “Panel” wildcards. This is when reviewers may use their wildcard during or after the panel discussion, i.e., after having learned what the other panel members think of the proposal. Supposed advantage: the reviewer can use their wildcard more strategically, and not waste it on proposals that would be funded anyway. Disadvantage: reviewer’s choice of using the wildcard would be skewed by the information they’d have collected during the panel meeting. For example, a reviewer may shy away from using a wildcard on an excellent, high-risk high-gain project, after learning that all of the other panel members strongly dislike that project."

    "text": "The CoARA Assessment Idea Catalogue is designed to be a resource for those developing and/or implementing assessment processes at a variety of different levels, including hiring, promotion, project funding, research programme funding, institutional evaluations or national research system evaluations. A collection of different experimental ideas are represented here, that can be used as inspiration for designing experiments that innovate on current assessment practices.\nAs the main output of the CoARA Working Group “Experiments in Assessment” (EiA), we aim to foster experimental ideas that advance research assessment towards a more holistic and inclusive definition of quality and excellence. This idea catalogue should help enable those responsible for assessment to experiment and innovate, driving bold and ambitious change to improve the quality of research across institutions and countries.\n\n\nThe goal of experiments is to test open questions, new ideas, and observations in a structured manner using the scientific method. While the process of experimentation has been the cornerstone of research for a long time, driving forward much of scientific knowledge, experiments to the processes of research are much more recent.\nWe are aware that both good practice exchanges as well as a growing body of literature in the area of metascience exist, and these are immensely valuable for everyone in the research ecosystem. However, there are very few centralized resources for ideas that haven’t been tested as well as evidence databases …We know there is good practice exchange, these are valuable. They don’t offer so much evidence yet, we need to build this! This catalogue isn’t just hypothetical experiments, also ones that exist/are being implemented, and the learnings can be put here as a resource\nResearch assessment experiments have many different goals, mostly based on tackling the different issues and overarching questions present in current assessment processes as well as reform initiatives (such as CoARA). The EiA Working Group identified 6 important questions that align with CoARA principles to help guide the development of the idea catalogue:\n\nHow do we create an assessment process based upon what the different players in research value?\n\nHow can we make research more inclusive and equitable through assessment?\n\nHow can we mitigate the negative effects of bias on assessment?\n\nHow can we better recognize process and culture through assessment?\n\nHow can we better foster diversity through assessment?\n\nHow can we better foster collaboration through assessment?\n\nHow can we ask assessment questions differently?\n\nThe ideas in this catalogue are seeds to develop questions in order to try and address these questions. Through experimenting on research assessment in different types of institutions, gathering evidence, and sharing them openly, we can improve processes determining how research and researchers get funded. By applying the principles of the scientific method to our own ecosystem, we will improve it for current and future generations.\nFor further reading on experiments in research assessment, we recommend:\n\nhttps://rori.figshare.com/articles/report/The_experimental_research_funder_s_handbook_final_version_/19459328?file=42259647\n\n*ANYTHING ELSE?*\n\n\n\n\nHow to find an idea:\n\nUse the search bar to look for keywords *Show picture of main window with search bar*\n\nFilter for ideas by using the categories. *Show picture of the category section* You can find ideas using the following categories:\n\nCoARA Commitments aligned with the idea\n\nWhich target group should implement the idea\n\nSpecific challenges in research assessment reform\n\nCompleteness of the idea and status of experimentation\n\n\nHow to implement an idea\n\n\n\nHow to comment on an idea or add evidence\n\nTO BE ADDED\n\nHow to add an idea\n\nIf you have an idea that would fit the idea catalogue, fill out the following template so that we can add it. *Download link to the template file*\n\nPlease keep the file in “.txt” format, and respect the headings and sections that are in there. Not all sections need to be filled out, but the more content present the more helpful the idea will be to others.\n\nThe template can also be used as a discussion framework for critical thinking and brainstorming about specific experimental ideas that you have in your institution, to develop them further\n\n\n\n\nSince 2024, the “Experiments in Assessment” Working Group has been collecting ideas and fostering discussion on potential experiments that could be part of the idea catalog. We had three main activities that have contributed to the content of this platform.\n\n\nFrom March 2024 until January 2025, an online one-question survey was open for responses from anyone who had ideas that they wanted to contribute. Over 90 responses were submitted, with a good number of interesting and innovative ideas for potential experiments.\n\n\n\nIn the second half of 2024, we organized two open workshops to discuss potential experiments that could be included in the idea catalogue. These workshops had participants from diverse roles and institutions, and the discussions led to both potential experiments to include as well as important themes that the Working Group could focus on in later brainstorming for potential experimental ideas..\n\n\n\nblah\n\n\n\n\nWe should add a link/upload our principles document as a reference/resource for others who want to do things as we did. Not as a “this is the right way forward”, but more of a “this is how we did it”.\n\nAdd a bit of text here to provide context, figure out how to weave it in…"
