<!--
GENERAL GUIDELINES:
- Use this guide to style all text: https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html
- Tags (apply as relevant):
Level 0 = Level of completeness: 0 – The experiment only contains the description and minimal details. This level is meant to provide inspiration for experiments that can be developed further by those experimenting.
Level 1 = Level of completeness: 1 –  The experiment contains minimal details. Organisations will need to build the experimentation plan before they can implement the idea.
Level 2 = Level of completeness: 2 – The experiment contains minimal details that may help with the design and implementation, but organisations will need to build most of the experimentation plan before they can fully implement the idea.
Level 3 = Level of completeness: 3 – The experiment contains some details that may help with the design and implementation, but organisations will need to finalise the experimentation plan before they can fully implement the idea.
Level 4 = Level of completeness: 4 – The experiment contains details that can provide useful guidance for implementation, but additional research will need to be done by experimenting organisation. Few real life cases exist. 
Level 5 = Level of completeness: 5 – The experiment contains sufficient details to be implemented, and it has already been experimented in some organisations providing cases, additional suggestions, and often learned lessons. 
Challenge - Process = Create an assessment process based upon what the different players in research value
Challenge - Inclusivity = Make research more inclusive and equitable through assessment
Challenge - Bias Mitigation = Mitigate the negative effects of bias on assessment
Challenge - Process Culture = Recognize process and culture through assessment
Challenge - Diversity = Foster diversity through assessment
Challenge - Collaboration = Foster collaboration through assessment
Challenge - Different Questions = Ask assessment questions differently
CoARA Commitment 1 = Recognise the diversity of contributions to, and careers in, research in accordance with the needs and nature of the research
CoARA Commitment 2 = Base research assessment primarily on qualitative evaluation for which peer review is central, supported by responsible use of quantitative indicators
CoARA Commitment 3 = Abandon inappropriate uses in research assessment of journal- and publication-based metrics, in particular inappropriate uses of Journal Impact Factor (JIF) and h-index
CoARA Commitment 4 = Avoid the use of rankings of research organisations in research assessment
CoARA Commitment 5 = Commit resources to reforming research assessment as is needed to achieve the organisational changes committed to
CoARA Commitment 6 = Review and develop research assessment criteria, tools and processes
CoARA Commitment 7 = Raise awareness of research assessment reform and provide transparent communication, guidance, and training on assessment criteria and processes as well as their use
CoARA Commitment 8 = Exchange practices and experiences to enable mutual learning within and beyond the Coalition
CoARA Commitment 9 = Communicate progress made on adherence to the Principles and implementation of the Commitments
CoARA Commitment 10 = Evaluate practices, criteria and tools based on solid evidence and the state-of-the-art in research on research, and make data openly available for evidence gathering and research
User - Funder = User could involve Funders and regional authorities
User - Institutes = User could involve Research institutions
User - Academies = User could involve Academies and learned societies
User - Research Groups = User could involve Research groups
User - Meta-Researchers = User could involve Meta-researchers
User - Scientific editors and publishers = User could involve Scientific editors and publishers

## Objectives and potential outcome
<!--
PROMPTS:
- What happens if this is successful? What changes if this works? 
- What improvements are we aiming for?
- These can be related to the main questions
- If there are multiple experiments fitting, put them here
-->

Some objectives and potential outcomes include:
- Peer review can be recognised and rewarded
- Greater responsibility of peer reviewers and accountability for the quality of their review
- Opportunity to make peer review an educational experience (if reviews are shared publicly)
- Possibility to monitor and ensure the openness of the diversity of reviewer pools
- Potentially reduces number of appeals
- Reduced competition in the research environment

## Research domains
<!--
PROMPTS:
- Which domain(s) can this experiment be applied in? 
-->


## Context and considerations
<!--
PROMPTS:
- Who is carrying out the evaluation? Who is this experiment for? (i.e., Target groups - Funders? Institutions? Individual researchers? Research domains?); 
- What type of assessment does this work on (Team/individual/project/institutional);
- What is the objective of evaluation exercise linked to the type of assessment
- What are the things that change in the experiment?
- Nature of the organization carrying out evaluation exercise; What type of assessment (Team/individual/project/institutional); Objective of evaluation exercise linked to the type of assessment
-->

## Challenges and mitigations
<!--
PROMPTS:
- Each challenge and mitigation grouped together
- If there isn’t mitigation, say so
- Tips and tricks for preparing and running the experiment
-->

**One challenge from open peer review is that it can reduce the honesty of reviewers who have concerns - make reviewers avoid raising issues, especially if the application is from someone renowned in their expertise.

## Evaluating success
<!--
PROMPTS:
- Evaluation criteria for the experiment 
- How do you know it worked or didn’t?
-->


## Related CoARA commitments
<!--
PROMPTS:
Directly reference as many of the 10 CoARA commitments as are fitting
