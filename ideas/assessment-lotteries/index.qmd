GENERAL GUIDELINES:
- Use this guide to style all text: https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html
- Tags (apply as relevant):
Level 0 = Level of completeness: 0 – The experiment only contains the description and minimal details. This level is meant to provide inspiration for experiments that can be developed further by those experimenting.
Level 1 = Level of completeness: 1 –  The experiment contains minimal details. Organisations will need to build the experimentation plan before they can implement the idea.
Level 2 = Level of completeness: 2 – The experiment contains minimal details that may help with the design and implementation, but organisations will need to build most of the experimentation plan before they can fully implement the idea.
Level 3 = Level of completeness: 3 – The experiment contains some details that may help with the design and implementation, but organisations will need to finalise the experimentation plan before they can fully implement the idea.
Level 4 = Level of completeness: 4 – The experiment contains details that can provide useful guidance for implementation, but additional research will need to be done by experimenting organisation. Few real life cases exist. 
Level 5 = Level of completeness: 5 – The experiment contains sufficient details to be implemented, and it has already been experimented in some organisations providing cases, additional suggestions, and often learned lessons. 
Challenge - Process = Create an assessment process based upon what the different players in research value
Challenge - Inclusivity = Make research more inclusive and equitable through assessment
Challenge - Bias Mitigation = Mitigate the negative effects of bias on assessment
Challenge - Process Culture = Recognize process and culture through assessment
Challenge - Diversity = Foster diversity through assessment
Challenge - Collaboration = Foster collaboration through assessment
Challenge - Different Questions = Ask assessment questions differently
CoARA Commitment 1 = Recognise the diversity of contributions to, and careers in, research in accordance with the needs and nature of the research
CoARA Commitment 2 = Base research assessment primarily on qualitative evaluation for which peer review is central, supported by responsible use of quantitative indicators
CoARA Commitment 3 = Abandon inappropriate uses in research assessment of journal- and publication-based metrics, in particular inappropriate uses of Journal Impact Factor (JIF) and h-index
CoARA Commitment 4 = Avoid the use of rankings of research organisations in research assessment
CoARA Commitment 5 = Commit resources to reforming research assessment as is needed to achieve the organisational changes committed to
CoARA Commitment 6 = Review and develop research assessment criteria, tools and processes
CoARA Commitment 7 = Raise awareness of research assessment reform and provide transparent communication, guidance, and training on assessment criteria and processes as well as their use
CoARA Commitment 8 = Exchange practices and experiences to enable mutual learning within and beyond the Coalition
CoARA Commitment 9 = Communicate progress made on adherence to the Principles and implementation of the Commitments
CoARA Commitment 10 = Evaluate practices, criteria and tools based on solid evidence and the state-of-the-art in research on research, and make data openly available for evidence gathering and research
User - Funder = User could involve Funders and regional authorities
User - Institutes = User could involve Research institutions
User - Academies = User could involve Academies and learned societies
User - Research Groups = User could involve Research groups
User - Meta-Researchers = User could involve Meta-researchers
User - Scientific editors and publishers = User could involve Scientific editors and publishers

## Objectives and potential outcome
<!--
PROMPTS:
- What happens if this is successful? What changes if this works? 
- What improvements are we aiming for?
- These can be related to the main questions
- If there are multiple experiments fitting, put them here
-->
Some objectives of assessment lotteries include:  

- **Addressing reviewer fatigue and frustration:** Reviewers put a lot of time and effort in reviewing proposals, even in situations where they are not able to distinguish between proposals and come to the conclusion that all proposals are equally fit for funding. When this (final) stage in the review process is replaced by a lottery, reviewers can spend their time on doing what they are good at (distinguishing proposals that deserve funding from the ones that are not worthy to get funding).
- **Create an equal playing field for certain types of research/researchers:** Lotteries can help address more subtle biases that impact researchers (e.g., underrepresented groups) or certain types of research (e.g., high risk research) since lotteries don’t discriminate (Read the challenges, one needs to be aware of how lotteries work!).  
- **Increase efficiency of evaluation processes, and reduce costs/resources:** Less time and effort is needed for the final part in the decision making process. The time investment by peer reviewers does not necessarily decrease. The role of the evaluators ends once they have grouped the proposals into three categories: should not / could / should be funded. They do not need to further rank the proposals in the ‘could’ group; these are entered into the lottery.

## Research domains
<!--
PROMPTS:
- Which domain(s) can this experiment be applied in? 
-->

Assessment lotteries may apply to all domains, but their use is generally limited to the evaluation of research proposals (funding); they are not used for evaluating researcher career advancement (e.g., hiring, promotion,...) since this area implies much more complex elements and challenges. 

## Context and considerations
<!--
PROMPTS:
- Who is carrying out the evaluation? Who is this experiment for? (i.e., Target groups - Funders? Institutions? Individual researchers? Research domains?); 
- What type of assessment does this work on (Team/individual/project/institutional);
- What is the objective of evaluation exercise linked to the type of assessment
- What are the things that change in the experiment?
- Nature of the organization carrying out evaluation exercise; What type of assessment (Team/individual/project/institutional); Objective of evaluation exercise linked to the type of assessment
-->

**Assessment lotteries can take different shapes:**
- Applications that meet basic criteria (eligibility criteria, quality standards, etc.) are not further evaluated, ranked etc. by evaluators, but a lottery is organised and the ‘winning’ lots get the funding.  
- A modified lottery can also be organised: In a first round the proposals are evaluated by peer reviewers, and only the proposals worthy of funding enter the lottery phase.
- Partial randomization can also take place: Have larger groups (e.g. Must be funded, should be funded, should not be funded), and then randomize where the limiting factor (budget) is applied - i.e. fund all of the “musts”, and randomly select the “shoulds”.  
- There is another kind of lottery, where randomization is used to select who is eligible to submit a funding proposal (see [Luebber et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-023-01649-y)). The main advantage of “pre-lotteries” relative to the other forms of lotteries is that they reduce the workload on applicants: applicants who do not win the lottery do not have to waste resources in writing their grant application.

**Costs to consider for institutions for implementing the experiment (framed as questions for the user):**
- How accepting is your community (applicants and evaluators) for trialing randomization/lotteries?

**Suggestions on how to implement (including research culture aspects)**
- Start small: small funding calls (limited total budget), small projects (small amount of money per project).  
- Foster and grow the buy-in and trust from the applicants and from the evaluators.  
- Communicate and be transparent about the lottery, how it works etc.  
- Publish the randomization process/algorithm (to build trust in the process).  

## Challenges and mitigations

- If there isn’t mitigation, say so
- Tips and tricks for preparing and running the experiment
-->

**Challenges:**
- Lotteries are not a quick fix to solve issues related to bias or equity, because they do not fix problems at the beginning of the pipeline: some people simply don’t apply, thus making the pool of applicants less diverse  
- In a (small) experiment the end result might be a less inclusive, equitable etc. outcome… - some basic knowledge of statistics is necessary to fully understand the pros and cons of lotteries  
- Applicants and evaluators might be sceptical about a lottery, but they accept it as a valid method to distribute research funding if the method is well explained to them. In addition, evaluators might find a lottery difficult because for them it is hard to acknowledge that they are not able to identify ‘the best’ proposals (feels like failing). This needs to be taken into consideration in the communication with the evaluators.  
- Research culture needs to be ready for this kind of experiment, e.g., a degree of openness is required (with evaluators being open about what they can achieve and what not).

**Mitigation discussion: (Questions to address or discuss to enable resolution on the possible challenges identified)**
- Open communication about why a lottery is being implemented, about what it will achieve and what not, about the statistics behind the model (due to the lottery for instance all money could go to one discipline, to only groups with a male PI etc.), about the outcomes (and the monitoring) of the lottery  
- Open communication about disadvantages of peer review procedures (e.g., the role of chance in peer review)  
- Start small, with smaller calls, budgets etc. so that all stakeholders can get used to the idea of a lottery  
- Align with larger goals, i.e. “increasing diversity of what is funded”, “eliminating panel/evaluator bias for difficult comparisons”
