## Objectives and potential outcome
<!--
PROMPTS:
- What happens if this is successful? What changes if this works? 
- What improvements are we aiming for?
- These can be related to the main questions
- If there are multiple experiments fitting, put them here
-->

If successful, academic support training will increase researchers’ understanding and engagement in assessment processes, enhancing transparency and trust. It will empower researchers to actively manage their evaluation, improve the fairness and accuracy of assessments, and promote a culture shift toward responsible, inclusive, and trajectory-based research evaluation.

:::

## Research domains
<!--
PROMPTS:
- Which domain(s) can this experiment be applied in? 
-->

This academic support training can be applied across all research domains, as the need to understand and navigate evaluation processes is universal. It is particularly valuable in interdisciplinary fields, where assessment criteria may vary, and for early-career researchers who require guidance to align their work with institutional and funder expectations.

## Context and considerations
<!--
PROMPTS:
- Who is carrying out the evaluation? Who is this experiment for? (i.e., Target groups - Funders? Institutions? Individual researchers? Research domains?); 
- What type of assessment does this work on (Team/individual/project/institutional);
- What is the objective of evaluation exercise linked to the type of assessment
- What are the things that change in the experiment?
- Nature of the organization carrying out evaluation exercise; What type of assessment (Team/individual/project/institutional); Objective of evaluation exercise linked to the type of assessment
-->

Nature of the Evaluating Organization:
- Academic institutions (universities, research centers) vs. funding agencies vs. governmental bodies.
- Organizational culture and readiness for change affect training adoption and impact.

Type of Evaluation:
- Individual researcher assessment (e.g., tenure, promotion).
- Team or project-level evaluation (collaborative grants, group performance).
- Institutional evaluation (university rankings, strategic reviews).

Objectives of the Evaluation Exercise:
- Career progression and talent development.
- Resource allocation and funding decisions.
- Compliance with open science, equity, or diversity mandates.
- Quality assurance and accountability.

Implications for Training Design:
- Content must align with evaluation type and organizational goals.
- Delivery methods may vary (online modules, workshops, mentoring).
- Tools for transparency and self-monitoring should be customized accordingly.


## Challenges and mitigations
<!--
PROMPTS:
- Each challenge and mitigation grouped together
- If there isn’t mitigation, say so
- Tips and tricks for preparing and running the experiment
-->

**Challenge: Resistance to culture change among staff and researchers
Mitigation:** 
- Implement phased, trajectory-based training to gradually build acceptance.
- Use champions or early adopters to promote benefits and share success stories.
- Provide incentives and recognize participation.


**Challenge: Diverse baseline knowledge and engagement levels across staff roles (HR, researchers, administrators)
 Mitigation:**
- Customize training content by role and career stage.
- Use modular and flexible formats (self-paced online, live sessions). 
If no mitigation: Assess user needs prior to design.


**Challenge: Lack of time and resources for staff to participate fully
Mitigation:**
- Integrate training into existing professional development frameworks.
- Provide microlearning options to reduce time burden.
If no mitigation: Seek management support for protected training time.

**Challenge: Measuring effectiveness and impact of culture change interventions
Mitigation:**
- Define clear KPIs and collect pre/post-training feedback.
- Use longitudinal tracking of behavior and assessment outcomes.
If no mitigation: Use qualitative feedback and case studies as alternative metrics.

**Challenge: Ensuring sustained engagement throughout the research lifecycle
Mitigation:**
- Design ongoing support and refresher training sessions.
- Implement mentoring and peer support networks.


## Evaluating success
<!--
