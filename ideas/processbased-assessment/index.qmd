<!--
GENERAL GUIDELINES:
- Use this guide to style all text: https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html
- Tags (apply as relevant):
Level 0 = Level of completeness: 0 – The experiment only contains the description and minimal details. This level is meant to provide inspiration for experiments that can be developed further by those experimenting.
Level 1 = Level of completeness: 1 –  The experiment contains minimal details. Organisations will need to build the experimentation plan before they can implement the idea.
Level 2 = Level of completeness: 2 – The experiment contains minimal details that may help with the design and implementation, but organisations will need to build most of the experimentation plan before they can fully implement the idea.
Level 3 = Level of completeness: 3 – The experiment contains some details that may help with the design and implementation, but organisations will need to finalise the experimentation plan before they can fully implement the idea.
Level 4 = Level of completeness: 4 – The experiment contains details that can provide useful guidance for implementation, but additional research will need to be done by experimenting organisation. Few real life cases exist. 
Level 5 = Level of completeness: 5 – The experiment contains sufficient details to be implemented, and it has already been experimented in some organisations providing cases, additional suggestions, and often learned lessons. 
Challenge - Process = Create an assessment process based upon what the different players in research value
Challenge - Inclusivity = Make research more inclusive and equitable through assessment
Challenge - Bias Mitigation = Mitigate the negative effects of bias on assessment
Challenge - Process Culture = Recognize process and culture through assessment
Challenge - Diversity = Foster diversity through assessment
Challenge - Collaboration = Foster collaboration through assessment
Challenge - Different Questions = Ask assessment questions differently
CoARA Commitment 1 = Recognise the diversity of contributions to, and careers in, research in accordance with the needs and nature of the research
CoARA Commitment 2 = Base research assessment primarily on qualitative evaluation for which peer review is central, supported by responsible use of quantitative indicators
CoARA Commitment 3 = Abandon inappropriate uses in research assessment of journal- and publication-based metrics, in particular inappropriate uses of Journal Impact Factor (JIF) and h-index
CoARA Commitment 4 = Avoid the use of rankings of research organisations in research assessment
CoARA Commitment 5 = Commit resources to reforming research assessment as is needed to achieve the organisational changes committed to
CoARA Commitment 6 = Review and develop research assessment criteria, tools and processes
CoARA Commitment 7 = Raise awareness of research assessment reform and provide transparent communication, guidance, and training on assessment criteria and processes as well as their use
CoARA Commitment 8 = Exchange practices and experiences to enable mutual learning within and beyond the Coalition
CoARA Commitment 9 = Communicate progress made on adherence to the Principles and implementation of the Commitments
CoARA Commitment 10 = Evaluate practices, criteria and tools based on solid evidence and the state-of-the-art in research on research, and make data openly available for evidence gathering and research
User - Funder = User could involve Funders and regional authorities
User - Institutes = User could involve Research institutions
User - Academies = User could involve Academies and learned societies
User - Research Groups = User could involve Research groups
User - Meta-Researchers = User could involve Meta-researchers
User - Scientific editors and publishers = User could involve Scientific editors and publishers
