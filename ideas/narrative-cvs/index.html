GENERAL GUIDELINES:
- Use this guide to style all text: https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html
- Tags (apply as relevant):
Level 0 = Level of completeness: 0 – The experiment only contains the description and minimal details. This level is meant to provide inspiration for experiments that can be developed further by those experimenting.
Level 1 = Level of completeness: 1 –  The experiment contains minimal details. Organisations will need to build the experimentation plan before they can implement the idea.
Level 2 = Level of completeness: 2 – The experiment contains minimal details that may help with the design and implementation, but organisations will need to build most of the experimentation plan before they can fully implement the idea.
Level 3 = Level of completeness: 3 – The experiment contains some details that may help with the design and implementation, but organisations will need to finalise the experimentation plan before they can fully implement the idea.
Level 4 = Level of completeness: 4 – The experiment contains details that can provide useful guidance for implementation, but additional research will need to be done by experimenting organisation. Few real life cases exist. 
Level 5 = Level of completeness: 5 – The experiment contains sufficient details to be implemented, and it has already been experimented in some organisations providing cases, additional suggestions, and often learned lessons.

<p>Narrative CVs were created to enable applicants to go beyond closed categories and to express outputs, impacts, activities and skills that would normally be difficult to place in an itemised CV format. Narrative CVs can be implemented for individuals or for teams.</p>
<ul>
<li>Objective 1: Diversify what is recognized or used in assessment</li>
<li>Objective 2: Create space for diverse career paths, outputs, competences, and achievements</li>
<li>Objective 3: Provide room for the assessed to express what really matters to them</li>
<li>Objective 4: Provide room for unquantifiable achievements and impacts</li>
<li>Objective 5: Discourage quantification and focus on productivity</li>

<p>Experimenting with Narrative CVs can be relevant for a broad array of stakeholders. Documented examples and implementation of Narrative CVs have taken place in research funding organisations, research institutions, and research academies, but Narrative CVs could realistically be implemented anywhere a traditional CV is used. Narrative CVs are most often used at an individual level, but they are also starting to be used at a team level for grant funding schemes (e.g., R4RI).</p>
<p>Narrative CVs have often been implemented before experimentation, yet research funding organisations and research institutions are also experimenting on Narrative CVs to understand how they impact assessment processes, how they shape assessment decisions, and how they shape the experience of applicants and reviewers. Examples of experiments include: - Surveys with applicants to understand their perspective, use, and experience with Narrative CVs - Surveys with assessors to understand their perspective, use, and experience with Narrative CVs - Surveys with review panel members to understand their perspective, use, and experience of Narrative CVs - Interviews, focus groups, and workshops with experts to understand their perspective, worries, and hopes about Narrative CVs - Secondary data analyses of the characteristics of projects and individuals funded before and after the implementation of Narrative CVs - Content analyses of Narrative CVs to understand the type of informations included in the CV and the tone with which it is presented (e.g., sentiment analyses) - Literature review (including grey literature) to bring together evidence around Narrative CVs</p>
<p>These experiments most often aim to capture perspectives and experiences with Narrative CVs, but some also aim to capture how the implementation of Narrative CVs shapes assessment processes and decisions. These latter points of investigation are especially important for understanding the potential implications of Narrative CVs, their impact on research success, research cultures, and research practices, as well as their unintended consequences. Other elements that could be studied are the impact of training or mentoring applicants and reviewers on the Narrative CV experience, the impact of diverse templates, length, and question formulation of narrative CVs on the information included in the application, the impact of complementary material used alongside the Narrative CV, or the impact of large language models on Narrative CVs.</p>
<p>Most experiments study the effects and impacts of Narrative CVs as they are implemented, rather than in a controlled trial manner. This is often a needed limitation to ensure that assessment processes remain fair and equal for all applicants. This is not a limitation per se, given that most current assessment methods were implemented without being tried-and-tested, but it opens an opportunity for metaresearch projects experimenting on Narrative CVs outside the a hiring and promotion or funding contingencies to address this gap.</p>

<!--
PROMPTS:

- Tips and tricks for preparing and running the experiment
-->
<p>Some challenges in implementing and experimenting with Narrative CVs have been documented in the literature. These include perceived challenges from (potential) users as well as reported challenges from those implementing or piloting with Narrative CVs.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Challenge - Disciplinary buy-in:</strong> <strong>Challenge:</strong> While some disciplines may already be comfortable using qualitative information in an evaluative manner, other disciplines may feel more comfortable with quantitative information, and may show a resistence in prioritising qualitative elements described in the narrative CV over other forms of metrics.<br>
<strong>Mitigation:</strong> Providing a space for everyone in the community to discuss and be heard is essential to enable a shared understanding and a shared perspective among different disciplines. Creating a platform for exchange could be a way to promote such dialogues, or enabling everyone involved in the institution to be involved in discussing the implementation of narrative CVs and in shaping their implementation can play a cricial role on future buy-in. In addition, building a more thorough metrics literacy can help individuals understand the limitations and illusion of objectivity that certain metrics provide, and equip users to identify how such metrics can be used responsibly to complement qualitative information. Thorough training for assessors and reviewers may also help in this regard.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Challenge - Perceived loss of objectivity:</strong> <strong>Challenge:</strong> Narrative CVs are sometimes criticised for reducing the objectivity of applications processes, especially when compared to numerical metrics.<br>
<strong>Mitigation:</strong> Building a more thorough metrics literacy can help individuals understand the limitations and illusion of objectivity that certain metrics provide, and equip users to identify how such metrics can be used responsibly to complement qualitative information. Thorough training for assessors and reviewers may also help in this regard.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Challenge - Labor:</strong> <strong>Challenge:</strong> Narrative CVs often raise a concern among applicants and reviewers because they may take more time and effort to complete and review. While the time and effort needed to complete or review narrative CVs compared to tabular CVs is debated (<a href="https://www.fnr.lu/narrative-cv/">see FNR reports on implementation and feedback reports</a>), introducing a new method will always take a moment of adaptation and require time and efforts by the applicants and assessors. In addition, narrative CVs are often (although not always) described as more adaptable, enabling applicants to target specific elements of the application better. Consequently, for applicants, narrative CVs may need to be taylored for each specific application, duplicating burdens and time needed for each application.<br>
<strong>Mitigation:</strong> A simple mitigation for the added labor that may be introduced by narrative CV is to reduce burden in other aspects of the process and to avoid duplication of information required - a problem that is often recurrent in any application processes. In addition, applicants may be encouraged to save and reuse their narrative CV and provided with the technical possibility of reimporting an editable version of their narrative CV in multiple applications on the same application system. Training to both assessors and applicants may also support, over time, a reduction of burdens associated with the exercise. Along the same lines, providing more time between assessments and reducing the assessment frequency (e.g., longer contracts, longer funding terms) could help secure time for better, more thorough applications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Challenge: Internal alignment at the organisation/change management:</strong> <strong>Challenge:</strong> Ensuring that the entire organisation is aligned on the purpose for implementation can be challenging.<br>
<strong>Mitigation:</strong> Aligning the narrative CV with the objectives and purpose of the institution/hiring team/funding scheme can help support stronger alignment between the objective of narrative CV implementation and the purpose within the organisation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Challenge - Scalability of the process:</strong> <strong>Challenge:</strong> Implementing narrative CVs may be daunting especially in small institutions or in very large programmes.<br>
<strong>Mitigation:</strong> Several organisation start implementing narrative CVs on smaller programmes (e.g., early career collaboration funds, travel funds) to pilot their implementation and all the procedures and technical and human efforts needed to embed the change. This can provide an overview of the resources needed, and enable a pave the way to larger-scale implementation.</p></li>

<!--
PROMPTS:

- How do you know it worked or didn’t?

<p>The successes of implementing narrative CVs should target the reasons for implementation. Were narrative CVs implemented to foster a diversity of successful candidates, to foster a diversity of research achievements, to align with DORA and CoARA? These motives should be explicit and the success of the implementation should be based on such motives.</p>
