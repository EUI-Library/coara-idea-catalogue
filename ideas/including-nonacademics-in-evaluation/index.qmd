## Objectives and potential outcome
<!--
PROMPTS:
- What happens if this is successful? What changes if this works? 
- What improvements are we aiming for?
- These can be related to the main questions
- If there are multiple experiments fitting, put them here
-->

:::

## Research domains
<!--
PROMPTS:
- Which domain(s) can this experiment be applied in? 
-->

This is especially relevant for funding evaluation, especially when assessing impacts, but it could also be relevant in a variety of domains and settings. 

## Context and considerations
<!--
PROMPTS:
- Who is carrying out the evaluation? Who is this experiment for? (i.e., Target groups - Funders? Institutions? Individual researchers? Research domains?); 
- What type of assessment does this work on (Team/individual/project/institutional);
- What is the objective of evaluation exercise linked to the type of assessment
- What are the things that change in the experiment?
- Nature of the organization carrying out evaluation exercise; What type of assessment (Team/individual/project/institutional); Objective of evaluation exercise linked to the type of assessment
-->


## Challenges and mitigations
<!--
PROMPTS:
- Each challenge and mitigation grouped together
- If there isn’t mitigation, say so
- Tips and tricks for preparing and running the experiment
-->


## Evaluating success
<!--
PROMPTS:
- Evaluation criteria for the experiment 
- How do you know it worked or didn’t?
-->


## Related CoARA commitments
