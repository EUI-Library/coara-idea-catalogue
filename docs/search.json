We had three main activities that have contributed to the content of this platform.\n\nOpen Survey\nFrom March 2024 until January 2025, an online one-question survey was open for responses from anyone who had ideas that they wanted to contribute. Over 90 responses were submitted, with a good number of interesting and innovative ideas for potential experiments.\n\n\nWorkshops and (grey) literature review\nIn the second half of 2024, we organized two open workshops to discuss potential experiments that could be included in the idea catalogue. These workshops had participants from diverse roles and institutions, and the discussions led to both potential experiments to include as well as important themes that the Working Group could focus on in later brainstorming for potential experimental ideas..\n\n\nThe input/expertise/experience of the group + discussion\n[to be added]"

The goal of this platform is to value the breadth and diversity of experiments, and there is no inherent judgement of the quality of experiments, especially if they conflict with others.\nThe goal of this platform is to provide inspiration and resources for you to develop assessment experiments in your own context, but we have no guarantee on the outcomes of any experiments that you implement based on the ideas found here.
