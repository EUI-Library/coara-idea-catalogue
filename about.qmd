# The CoARA Assessment Idea Catalogue

The CoARA Assessment Idea Catalogue is designed to be a resource for those developing and/or implementing assessment processes at a variety of different levels, including hiring, promotion, project funding, research programme funding, institutional evaluations or national research system evaluations. A collection of different experimental ideas are represented here, that can be used as inspiration for designing experiments that innovate on current assessment practices.

As the main output of the CoARA Working Group “Experiments in Assessment” (EiA), we aim to foster experimental ideas that advance research assessment towards a more holistic and inclusive definition of quality and excellence. This idea catalogue should help enable those responsible for assessment to experiment and innovate, driving bold and ambitious change to improve the quality of research across institutions and countries. 

## What is an experiment? Why experiment on assessment?

The goal of experiments is to test open questions, new ideas, and observations in a structured manner using the scientific method. While the process of experimentation has been the cornerstone of research for a long time, driving forward much of scientific knowledge, experiments to the processes of research are much more recent. 

We are aware that both good practice exchanges as well as a growing body of literature in the area of metascience exist, and these are immensely valuable for everyone in the research ecosystem. However, there are very few centralized resources for ideas that haven’t been tested as well as evidence databases …We know there is good practice exchange, these are valuable. They don’t offer so much evidence yet, we need to build this\! This catalogue isn’t just hypothetical experiments, also ones that exist/are being implemented, and the learnings can be put here as a resource

Research assessment experiments have many different goals, mostly based on tackling the different issues and overarching questions present in current assessment processes as well as reform initiatives (such as CoARA). The EiA Working Group identified 6 important questions that align with CoARA principles to help guide the development of the idea catalogue:

- How do we create an assessment process based upon what the different players in research value?    
- How can we make research more inclusive and equitable through assessment?   
- How can we mitigate the negative effects of bias on assessment?   
- How can we better recognize process and culture through assessment?   
- How can we better foster diversity through assessment?   
- How can we better foster collaboration through assessment?   
- How can we ask assessment questions differently?

The ideas in this catalogue are seeds to develop questions in order to try and address these questions. Through experimenting on research assessment in different types of institutions, gathering evidence, and sharing them openly, we can improve processes determining how research and researchers get funded. By applying the principles of the scientific method to our own ecosystem, we will improve it for current and future generations.

## How to use the idea catalogue

How to find an idea:

- Use the search bar to look for keywords \*Show picture of main window with search bar\*   
- Filter for ideas by using the categories.  \*Show picture of the category section\* You can find ideas using the following categories:  
  - CoARA Commitments aligned with the idea  
  - Which target group should implement the idea  
  - Specific challenges in research assessment reform  
  - Completeness of the idea and status of experimentation

How to add an idea

- If you have an idea that would fit the idea catalogue, fill out the following template so that we can add it. \*Download link to the template file\*  
- Please keep the file in “.txt” format, and respect the headings and sections that are in there. Not all sections need to be filled out, but the more content present the more helpful the idea will be to others.  
- The template can also be used as a discussion framework for critical thinking and brainstorming about specific experimental ideas that you have in your institution, to develop them further

## Development of the platform \- Where did these ideas come from?

Since 2024, the “Experiments in Assessment” Working Group has been collecting ideas and fostering discussion on potential experiments that could be part of the idea catalog. We had three main activities that have contributed to the content of this platform.

### Open Survey

From March 2024 until January 2025, an online one-question survey was open for responses from anyone who had ideas that they wanted to contribute. Over 90 responses were submitted, with a good number of interesting and innovative ideas for potential experiments.

### Workshops and (grey) literature review 

In the second half of 2024, we organized two open workshops to discuss potential experiments that could be included in the idea catalogue. These workshops had participants from diverse roles and institutions, and the discussions led to both potential experiments to include as well as important themes that the Working Group could focus on in later brainstorming for potential experimental ideas.. 

### The input/expertise/experience of the group \+ discussion

### Principles of the WG

- We should add a link/upload our principles document as a reference/resource for others who want to do things as we did. Not as a “this is the right way forward”, but more of a “this is how we did it”.  
- Add a bit of text here to provide context, figure out how to weave it in… 

# Disclaimer

This idea catalogue platform is not a comprehensive list of experiments for innovating research assessment. There are many potential experimental ideas that we recognize as fitting into the platform, and we welcome any constructive support in adding additional experiments.

Due to the breadth of experimental ideas, the different experiments in the catalogue may be conflicting with one another. The goal of this platform is to value the breadth and diversity of experiments, and there is no inherent judgement of the quality of experiments, especially if they conflict with others.

The goal of this platform is to provide inspiration and resources for you to develop assessment experiments in your own context, but we have no guarantee on the outcomes of any experiments that you implement based on the ideas found here. We are not legally liable or responsible for your experiments, but we are happy for your feedback on your experiences.
