## Introduction

The **CaARA Assessment Idea Catalogue** is designed to be a resource for those developing and/or implementing assessment processes at a variety of different levels, including:

- hiring and promotion
- project funding
- research programme funding
- institutional evaluations 
- national research system evaluations. 

A collection of different experimental ideas are represented here, that can be used as inspiration for designing experiments that innovate on current assessment practices.

As the main output of the **CoARA Working Group “Experiments in Assessment”**, we aim to foster experimental ideas that advance research assessment towards a more holistic and inclusive definition of quality and excellence. This idea catalogue should help enable those responsible for assessment to experiment and innovate, driving bold and ambitious change to improve the quality of research across institutions and countries. 

## Why experiment with new ideas?

We invite you to read:

Bendiscioli, Sandra; Firpo, Teo; Bravo-Biosca, Albert; Czibor, Eszter; Garfinkel, Michele; Stafford, Tom; et al. (2022). The experimental research funder’s handbook (2nd edition).

## Development of the platform - Where did these ideas come from?
Since 2024, the “Experiments in Assessment” Working Group has been collecting ideas and fostering discussion on potential experiments that could be part of the idea catalog. We had three main activities that have contributed to the content of this platform.

#### Open Survey
From March 2024 until January 2025, an online one-question survey was open for responses from anyone who had ideas that they wanted to contribute. Over 90 responses were submitted, with a good number of interesting and innovative ideas for potential experiments.

#### Workshops and (grey) literature review 
In the second half of 2024, we organized two open workshops to discuss potential experiments that could be included in the idea catalogue. These workshops had participants from diverse roles and institutions, and the discussions led to both potential experiments to include as well as important themes that the Working Group could focus on in later brainstorming for potential experimental ideas..

## Disclaimer
This idea catalogue platform is not a comprehensive list of experiments for innovating research assessment. There are many potential experimental ideas that we recognize as fitting into the platform, and we welcome any constructive support in adding additional experiments.

Due to the breadth of experimental ideas, the different experiments in the catalogue may be conflicting with one another. The goal of this platform is to value the breadth and diversity of experiments, and there is no inherent judgement of the quality of experiments, especially if they conflict with others.

The goal of this platform is to provide inspiration and resources for you to develop assessment experiments in your own context, but we have no guarantee on the outcomes of any experiments that you implement based on the ideas found here. We are not legally liable or responsible for your experiments, but we are happy for your feedback on your experiences.
